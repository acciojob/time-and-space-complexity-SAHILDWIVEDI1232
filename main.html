		Understanding Time and Space Complexity.
	</h1>
	 <p>
    Time complexity is a way to analyze how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets.
  </p>
	<p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. An algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input.
